This repository is a collection of programs implemented during the Computer Networks Laboratory at JSS Science And Technology University(SJCE). The projects cover a range of topics related to computer networks, including both Java and NS2 implementations.

## Projects

### 1. Java Programs

1. Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques 
2. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits). 
3. Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.
4. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.
5. Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.
6. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.
7. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm
and token bucket algorithm.
8. Write a program to implement random early detection (RED)
congestion control algorithm.

### 2. Simulation Experiments using NS2

1. a. Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.  
   b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
2. a. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.
   b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.

## Usage

##### Example command for running a Java program
javac program_name.java
java program_name

##### Example command for running an NS2 simulation
ns program_name.tcl
